\begin{abstract}
Nearly all viruses exhibit some antigenic variation.
However, the extent of this variation ranges widely across viruses and antibodies.
Influenza virus exhibits high antigenic variation, and can completely escape most neutralizing antibodies with single mutations.
However, rare antibodies broadly neutralize many influenza virus strains.
It is unclear how easily the virus might escape such broad antibodies if there was strong selection to do so.
Here we map all single amino-acid mutations to an H1 influenza hemagglutinin that increase resistance to several broad antibodies.
Crucially, our approach both identifies antigenic mutations and quantifies their effect size.
We find mutations that increase resistance to all antibodies tested, but the effect sizes range widely. 
Single mutations completely escape a broad antibody targeting the hemagglutinin receptor-binding pocket, similar to escape from narrow strain-specific antibodies.   
In contrast, the few mutations selected by broad antibodies targeting the hemagglutinin stalk have only small effects. 
Overall, our work demonstrates a method to quantify the ease of viral antibody escape, and shows that antibody breadth is not necessarily an indicator of the difficulty of viral escape.
In addition, our results show that broad antibodies targeting the hemagglutinin stalk are quantifiably harder to escape via point mutations.

\section*{INTRODUCTION}
Broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza virus are of great interest... \cite{corti2017tackling}. 

% blurbs about the specific antibodies we use here:
C179 isolation and escape mutant selection \cite{okuno1993common}.
C179 structure with 1957 H2, binding data to many strains, and citations to older studies demonstrating C179 cross-neutralization to H1, H2, H5, H6, and H9:  \cite{dreyfus2013structure}.
FI6v3 was isolated... \cite{corti2011neutralizing}.
S139/1 isolation and selection of escape mutants from Aichi H3, Adachi H2, and WSN H1: \cite{yoshida2009cross}.
S139/1 structure with Victoria75 H3 and binding/neutralization data: \cite{lee2012heterosubtypic}.

Recently we have described new technologies... \cite{doud2017complete, dingens2017comprehensive}.

\comment{Can you make the following changes:
(1) Add H17-L10 and H17-L7. These could just be in different shades of red since they are all narrow antibodies like H17-L19. (2) Make the structure slightly larger relative to the tree. (3) Increase the line widths on the tree and the font sizes everywhere. (4) Move the color-based label to the left side of the tree so it falls between the two panels, since it is really labeling both. (5) Make the tree branches all black. Since color is already being used to represent the different antibodies, I think it is confusing to also use it to distinguish Group 1 and Group 2.}}

\comment{Can you modify this plot to bring the formatting more in line with Figure~\ref{fig:fracsurvive_example}. 
This includes:
(1) Make the y-axis \emph{fraction infectivity}.
(2) Make the vertical lines dotted and of the same color as in Figure~\ref{fig:fracsurvive_example}, which is the last color in the \emph{cbbPalette} defined here \url{https://github.com/jbloomlab/HA_antibody_ease_of_escape/blob/master/paper/figs/fracsurvive_example/fracsurvive_example.ipynb}. 
(3) Get rid of the minor tick marks that show up on two of the four plots.
(4) Add H17-L10 and H17-L9, and make the plot three antibodies per line.
(5) Get rid of the concentration of S139/1 that we are not using.
(6) Also, I think it would look better if for each plot the antibody name was just a title above the plot in large letters. The x-axis then can then just ``antibody concentration ($\mu$g/ml)''. Also, I don't think you need the number labels for the concentrations on either the plot or in the table. If your table has the concentration and fraction infectivity, it is obvious which line goes with which concentration just by seeing how they are arranged horizontally.
(7) Increase the font size in the table (you'll have more space to do this after you get rid of the numbers).

\section*{METHODS}
\subsection*{Antibodies}
FI6v3 was expressed and purified by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center protein expression core \comment{i think?}.
C179 was purchased from Takara Bio Inc (Catalog \# M145).
S139/1 heavy and light chain variable sequences were obtained from PDB ID 4GMS~\cite{lee2012heterosubtypic} and expressed and purified by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center protein expression core.

\subsection*{Mutant virus selections with antibody}
Library selections, deep sequencing, and computation of mutation differential selection were performed as previously described~\cite{doud2017complete}. Briefly, ...

\subsection*{Computation of the fraction $\phi_{r,a}$ of each mutation that escapes antibody neutralization}
\comment{depending on how much of paper focus is on this new metric, some of this rationale might be better placed in the results section}

Mutation differential selection values $s_{r,a}$ reflect the enrichment of a mutation in an antibody-selected sample relative to a mock-selected control. 
The extent of these mutation enrichments are dependent on the stringency of the neutralization: as the concentration of an antibody used to neutralize the mutant virus library is increased, a larger proportion of the virus library is neutralized, and escape mutants become more enriched in the antibody-selected sample relative to the control sample~\cite{doud2017complete}.
Consequently, due to differences in the concentrations and potencies of various antibodies used in mutational antigenic profiling, quantitative comparisons of the effects of mutations on neutralization escape between various antibodies is confounded by differences in neutralization stringency across experiments.

We defined a new metric that accounts for the neutralization stringency of each experiment so that quantitative comparisons can be made between experiments with varying neutralization stringencies.
This new measure, $\phi_{r,a}$, is roughly analogous to the fraction of mutant viruses carrying mutation $a$ at site $r$ that escape neutralization by a given antibody.
The computation of $\phi_{r,a}$ incorporates information about the stringency of neutralization. 
We define this as  $\gamma$ = (100 - \% neutralization)/100), the fraction of library remaining infectious after antibody neutralization measured by qRT-PCR for each antibody-selection experiment as previously described~\cite{doud2017complete}.

Define $\hat{n}_{r,a}^{sel}$ and $\hat{n}_{r,a}^{mock}$ as the number of error-corrected counts of amino-acid mutant $a$ at site $r$ as defined in~\cite{doud2017complete}, and $N_r^{sel}$ and $N_r^{mock}$ be the total counts at site $r$, as specified for either an antibody selection or matched mock condition.
Let $P$ be a pseudocount (default to 5 in these analyses) added to amino-acid counts, and let $f_{r}^{sel}$ and $f_{r}^{mock}$ be relative depths of the selected and mock samples at site $r$ for the purposes of scaling the pseudocount by relative read depth as previously described~\cite{doud2017complete}.

Define the pseudocount-adjusted frequency $\rho$ of mutant $a$ at site $r$ in selected and mock samples to be:
$$\rho_{r,a}^{sel} = \frac{n_{r,a}^{sel}+f_r^{sel}\times P}{N_r^{sel}+f_r^{sel}\times  P}$$
$$\rho_{r,a}^{mock} = \frac{n_{r,a}^{mock}+f_r^{mock}\times P}{N_r^{mock}+f_r^{mock}\times  P}$$

We define $\phi_{r,a}$ as the net `fraction' of mutant $a$ at site $r$ escaping neutralization (above the average escape fraction $\gamma$), and compute this as:
$$\phi_{r,a} = \frac{\gamma \times \rho_{r,a}^{sel}}{\rho_{r,a}^{mock}} - \gamma$$

By this definition, mutations with no effect on antibody escape will have $\phi_{r,a} =0$, and mutations completely escaping antibody will have $\phi_{r,a} \approx 1$.
Care should be taken in interpreting the absolute values of $\phi$, however, since the choice of pseudocount affects the range of $\phi$ values (but not, importantly, the relationships of $\phi$ distributions across antibodies).
We have found that a value of $P=5$ pseudocounts results in $\phi$ values that are roughly bounded from 0 to 1, and consistently use $P=5$ all analyses.

\subsection*{Data availability and source code}
Deep sequencing data has been deposited at the Sequence Read Archive under BioSample accession (\comment{should probably deposit all the new data into the existing biosample SAMN05789126 (Sample name: WSN/1933 HA mutant libraries selected by monoclonal antibodies), which is under bioproject PRJNA309339}).
