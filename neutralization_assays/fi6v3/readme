here is the experimental notebook, platereader data, and some plotting for neutralization assay validation of fi6v3 resistance mutations.

V148T is an H17L19 escape mutation that also adds a putative glycosylation site (similar to the top FI6v3 resistance mutations), but in the head not the stalk, thus this is a negative control for escape from FI6v3.
H17L19 was used as a negative control antibody for the FI6v3 resistance mutations, and in that experiment the V148T mutant virus is a positive control for escape.

a more thorough analysis at the time of the experiments is in my other repository: 
WSN-HA_mAb_dms/NeutralizationCurves/FI6v3_neutralization_curves.ipynb
in that notebook I also analyzed some pilot experiments to figure out the appropriate virus concentration for the assay.

in this repository i'm adding a more streamlined notebook that plots the final data in a few alternate forms as possibilities for a paper figure.
