# Quantifiying the effects of single mutations on viral escape from broad and narrow antibodies to an H1 influenza hemagglutinin

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis code, data, and paper for this study.
A pre-print is available on _bioRxiv_ at [DOI 10.1101/210468](https://doi.org/10.1101/210468).
The final published manuscript will soon be available in _Nature Communications_.

The study and paper are by Mike Doud, Juhye Lee, and Jesse Bloom in [Bloom lab](https://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html).

Briefly, the study maps how all mutations an H1 hemagglutinin (from A/WSN/1933 strain) affect neutralization by a variety of narrow (strain-specific) and broadly neutralizing antibodies.

## Organization
This repository is organized into a series of subdirectories as follows:

* [./analysis_code/](./analysis_code/) contains a Jupyter notebook that performs all of the analyses of the deep sequencing data for the mutational antigenic profiling.

* [./paper/](./paper/) contains the paper.

* [./neutralization_assays/](./neutralization_assays/) contains experimental data from neutralization assays and its analysis.

* [./lab_notes/]([./lab_notes/) contains lab notes and data from some of the experiments.
