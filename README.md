# How single mutations affect viral escape from broad and narrow antibodies to H1 influenza hemagglutinin

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis code, data, and paper for this study.
The final published manuscript is at [_Nature Communications_, 9:1386 (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03665-3).

The study and paper are by Mike Doud, Juhye Lee, and Jesse Bloom in [Bloom lab](https://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html).

Briefly, the study maps how all mutations an H1 hemagglutinin (from A/WSN/1933 strain) affect neutralization by a variety of narrow (strain-specific) and broadly neutralizing antibodies.

## Organization
This repository is organized into a series of subdirectories as follows:

* [./analysis_code/](./analysis_code/) contains a Jupyter notebook that performs all of the analyses of the deep sequencing data for the mutational antigenic profiling.

* [./paper/](./paper/) contains the paper.

* [./neutralization_assays/](./neutralization_assays/) contains experimental data from neutralization assays and its analysis.

* [./lab_notes/]([./lab_notes/) contains lab notes and data from some of the experiments.
